# B2B Auto‑Parts Lead‑Analytics Dashboard (v3)

This version adds **median imputation** for numeric features so models run even
when columns such as *Conversion_Time_Days* contain NaNs.

Edit `DEFAULT_URL` near the top of *app.py* to point to your GitHub raw CSV.

Deploy steps are the same as earlier versions.
